## Introduction

Your data was not normally distributed. Now what?

The process generating your data is probably following some distribution.
The size distribution of cities appears to follow a Pareto distibution, as is
wealth. The number of mutations in a string of DNA appears to follow a 
poisson distribution. And the distribution of wind speeds as well as
times to failure for technical components both follow the Weibull distribution.

If you have a theoretical foundation for which distribution you data generating
function follows, that is nice. 

If you do not - we will be interested in figuring out which distribution your
data actually follow.

## How?

We fit our data to a distribution. Or rather - we fit the data to several
different distributions and then choose the best.

Let us look at some data. The `faithful` data set contains 272 observations of
the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park in USA. We only look at 
eruptions that lasts longer than 3 minutes:


``` r
library(tidyverse)
eruption_example <- faithful %>% 
  filter(eruptions > 3) %>% 
  dplyr::select(eruptions)
```

:::: instructor

Det er nødvendigt at specificere at vi bruger `dplyr::select` da den maskeres af
MASS-pakken

::::

Rather than testing a lot of different distributions, we can use the `gamlss`
package, and two add-ons to that.


``` r
library(gamlss)
library(gamlss.dist)
library(gamlss.add)
```

`gamlss` has the advantage of implementing a _lot_ of different statistical 
distributions.



The function `fitDist()` from `gamlss` will fit the data to a selection of different
statistical distributions, calculate a measure of the goodness of fit, and return
the best fit (and information on all the others). Rather than testing against all 
97 different distributions supported by `gamlss`, we can specify only a selection,
in this case `realplus`, that only includes the 23 distributions that are defined
for positive, real numbers:



``` r
fit <- fitDist(eruptions, type = "realplus", data = eruption_example)
```

If you do this yourself, you will notice a lot of error-messages. It is not 
possible to fit this particular data to _all_ the distributions, and the ones
where the fit fails (enough), we will get an error message.

The output from `fitDist()` will return the best fit:


``` r
fit
```

``` output

Family:  c("WEI2", "Weibull type 2") 
Fitting method: "nlminb"

            AIC:     179.245 
            SBC:     185.574 
```
We are told that the statistical distribution that best fits the data is
`Weibull type 2` and that the AIC-measurement of goodness of fit is 170.245.

:::: callout
Is that a good fit? That is a good question. It strongly depends on the 
values in the dataset. In this dataset, the length of the eruptions are 
measured in minutes If we choose to measure that length in another unit, eg
seconds,
the distribution should not change. But the AIC will.

We can use the AIC to decide that one distribution fits the data better than 
another, but not to conclude that that distribution is the correct one.
::::

The `fit` object containing the output of the `fitDist()` function contains 
quite a bit more.

If we start by getting the errors out of the way, `fit$failed` returns the 
two distributions that failed enough to cause errors:


``` r
fit$failed
```

``` output
[[1]]
[1] "GIG"

[[2]]
[1] "LNO"
```
As mentioned `fitDist()` fitted the data to 23 different distributions. We can
inspect the rest, and their associated AIC-values like this:


``` r
fit$fits
```

``` output
    WEI2     WEI3      WEI       GG    BCPEo     BCPE    BCCGo     BCCG 
179.2449 179.2449 179.2449 181.1349 181.4953 181.4953 183.1245 183.1245 
     GB2      BCT     BCTo   exGAUS       GA   LOGNO2    LOGNO       IG

202.6759 861.8066 863.8067 863.8079 863.8081 
```
Here we get `WEI2` first, with an AIC of 179.2449, but we can see that `WEI3` and
`WEI1` have almost exactly the same AIC. Not that surprising if we guess that 
`Weibull type 3` is probably rather similar to `Weibull type 2`. 

The difference in AIC for the first two distributions tested is very small. Is it
large enough for us to think that `WEI2` is significantly better than `WEI3`?

No. As a general rule of thumb, the difference between the AIC of two distributions
have to be larger than 2 for us to see a significant difference.

We can get more details using the `summary()` function:

``` r
summary(fit)
```

## What about the other options?

### General comments

Above we got the "best" fit. But we also noted that in order for us to conclude
that one distribution is a better fit than another, the difference in AIC should
be at least 2.

What we are looking for might not actually be the probability distribution that
best fits our data. Our data might be noisy or there might me systematic errors.
The probability distribution we really want, is the one that best matches 
the underlying data generating function, the mechanisms in the real world that
we are studying, that actually is at the hearth of the data we collect.

We might not be able to find that. But we should consider if some of the other
possibilities provided by `fitDist()` might actually be better.

:::: instructor

Og her er det vi holder dem fast på at det faktisk er dem selv der er de
bedst kvalificerede til at afgøre det. For det er dem der forstår domænet og data.

::::

First step is to look at the relevant distributions. In the setup with
`gamlss`, `gamlss.dist` and `gamlss.add` we can test distributions of different
types. The complete list can be found using the help function for `fitDist()`, but
falls in the following families:

* realline - continuous distributions for all real values
* realplus - continuous distributions for positive real values
* realAll - all continuous distributions - the combination of realline and realplus
* real0to1 - continuous distributions defined for real values between 0 and 1
* counts - distributions for counts
* binom - binomial distributions

Begin by considering which type whatever your data is describing, best matches. 

### Actually looking at the fits

For the selection of eruptions that we fitted, we chose 
the "realplus" selection of distibutions to test. We did that, because
the eruption times are all positive, and on the real number line.

:::: instructur

"Real numbers", på dansk reelle tal. Hvis du ved hvad imaginære
tal er, ved du også hvad reelle tal er. Hvis ikke - så er reelle tal alle de tal
du vil tænke på som tal.

::::

Behind the scenes `fitDist` fits the data to the chosen selection of distributions,
and returns the best.

Looking at the result of the fit we see this:


``` r
fit
```

``` output

Family:  c("WEI2", "Weibull type 2") 
Fitting method: "nlminb" 

Call:  gamlssML(formula = y, family = DIST[i]) 

Mu Coefficients:
[1]  -18.69
Sigma Coefficients:
[1]  2.524

 Degrees of Freedom for the fit: 2 Residual Deg. of Freedom   173 
Global Deviance:     175.245 
            AIC:     179.245 
            SBC:     185.574 
```

In the `Call` part of the output, we see this: 

`Call:  gamlssML(formula = y, family = DIST[i])` 

and from that we can deduces that if we want to fit the data to eg the log-normal 
distribution (in the documentation we find that the abbreviation for that is 
"LOGNO"), we can do it like this:


``` r
log_norm_fit <- gamlss(eruptions ~ 1, family = LOGNO, data = eruption_example)
```

``` output
GAMLSS-RS iteration 1: Global Deviance = 194.3047 
GAMLSS-RS iteration 2: Global Deviance = 194.3047 
```

``` r
summary(log_norm_fit)
```

``` output
