## Introduction

Barcharts are easy to make, but how can we get them to look nicer?

This is a checklist for cleaning up your barchart.

We start by getting some data:


``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

``` output
── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5
✔ forcats   1.0.1     ✔ stringr   1.6.0
✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0
✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1
✔ purrr     1.2.0     
── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
ℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors
```

``` r
library(palmerpenguins)
```

``` output

Attaching package: 'palmerpenguins'

The following objects are masked from 'package:datasets':

    penguins, penguins_raw
```

``` r
penguin_example <- penguins %>% 
  select(species)
```

Barcharts and histograms are often confused. Histograms visualizes 1 dimentional
data, barcharts 2 dimensional. The easy way to distinguish them is the white space
between the columns. Histograms are describing a continious set of data, broken
down into bins. Therefore there is no breaks between the columns. Barcharts 
describes values in discrete categories.

A further distinction in ggplot is between bar charts and column charts.

Bar charts, made with `geom_bar()` makes the height of the bar propotional to the
number of cases/observations in each group, where as `geom_col` makes the heights
proportional to a value in the group - that is just one value pr. group.

:::: callout

The way this happens is in the inner workings of the ggplot object. All `geom`s 
come with an associated function/argument `stats`, that controls the statistical
transformation of the input data. In `geom_bar` that transformation is `stat_count()`,
that counts the observations in each group. In `geom_col´ it is ´stat_identity()`,
which does nothing with the data.

Men det er egentlig ikke vigtigt her - fokus er på hvordan man får 
et barchart til at se pænere ud.

The us make the first barchart:


``` r
penguin_example %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = species)) + 
geom_bar() 
```

<img src="fig/barcharts-rendered-first-example-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This barchart is _boring_. Grey in grey.

## Step 1 - colours and labels

The first step would be to do something about the colours, and add labels and
a title to the plot:


``` r
penguin_example %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = species)) + 
geom_bar(fill = "darkorchid3") +
labs(
  x = element_blank(),
  y = "Number of penguins",
  title = "Number of penguins at Palmer Station, Antarctica")
```

``` warning
Warning: `label` cannot be a <ggplot2::element_blank> object.
```

<img src="fig/barcharts-rendered-colours-labels-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
It is not strictly necessary to remove the label of the x-axis, but it is superfluous
in this case.

## Second step - the order of the bars

Note that the plot orders the species of penguins in alphabetical order. For
some purposes this is perfectly fine. But in general we prefer to have the 
categories ordered by size, that is the number of observations.

The order of categories can be controlled by converting the observations to a 
categorical value, and ordering the levels in that `factor` by frequency.

The `forcats` library makes that relatively easy, using the function `fct_infreq()`,
which converts the character vector that is `species` to a factor with levels
ordered by frequency:


``` r
penguin_example %>% 
  mutate(species = fct_infreq(species)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = species)) + 
geom_bar(fill = "darkorchid3") +
labs(
  x = element_blank(),
  y = "Number of penguins",
  title = "Number of penguins at Palmer Station, Antarctica")
```

``` warning
Warning: `label` cannot be a <ggplot2::element_blank> object.
```

<img src="fig/barcharts-rendered-order-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
This facilitates the reading of the graph - it becomes very easy to see that 
the most frequent species of penguin is Adelie penguins.

Ja, det er let nok ellers, men nu er det ekstremt let.

## Rotating the plot

We only have three here, but if we have a lot of categories, it is often
preferable to have the columns as bars on the y-axis. We do that by changing 
the `x` in the `aes()` function to `y`:


``` r
penguin_example %>% 
  mutate(species = fct_infreq(species)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(y = species)) + 
geom_bar(fill = "darkorchid3") +
labs(
  y = element_blank(),
  x = "Number of penguins",
  title = "Number of penguins at Palmer Station, Antarctica")
```

``` warning
Warning: `label` cannot be a <ggplot2::element_blank> object.
```

<img src="fig/barcharts-rendered-rotation-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Size of text

The default size of the text on labels, title etc is a bit to the small side.
To improve readability, we change the base_size parameter in the default theme
of ggplot to 14. You might need to play around with the value, depending on 
the number of categories. 



``` r
penguin_example %>% 
  mutate(species = fct_infreq(species)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(y = species)) + 
geom_bar(fill = "darkorchid3") +
labs(
  y = element_blank(),
  x = "Number of penguins",
  title = "Number of penguins at Palmer Station, Antarctica") +
  theme_grey(base_size = 14) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.1)))
```

``` warning
Warning: `label` cannot be a <ggplot2::element_blank> object.
```

<img src="fig/barcharts-rendered-text-size-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
We also changed the scaling of the title of the plot. The size of that is now 
10% larger than the base size. We can do that by specifying a specific size, but
here we have done it using the `rel()` function which changes the size relative to
the base font size in the plot.

## Removing unnecessary space

There is a bit of empty space between the columns and the labels on the y-axis.

Let us get rid of that:


``` r
penguin_example %>% 
  mutate(species = fct_infreq(species)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(y = species)) + 
geom_bar(fill = "darkorchid3") +
labs(
  y = element_blank(),
  x = "Number of penguins",
  title = "Number of penguins at Palmer Station, Antarctica") +
  theme_grey(base_size = 14) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.1))) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.01)))
```

``` warning
Warning: `label` cannot be a <ggplot2::element_blank> object.
```

<img src="fig/barcharts-rendered-unnecessary-space-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
We control what is happening on the x-scale by using the family of `scale_x` functions.
Because it is a continuous scale, more specifically `scale_x_continuous()`.

What is happening by default is that the scale is expanded relative to the minimum
and maximum values of the data. If we want to change that, we cab either add absolute
values (or subtract by using negative values), or we can make a change relative
to the data. That makes the change robust to changes in the underlying data.

The mult() function in this case add 0 expansion to the left side of the scale,
and 1% ~ 0.01 to the righthand side of the scale.


## Remove clutter

There ar horizontal lines in the plot background that are unnessecary. And the 
grey background we get by default is not very nice. Remove them:


``` r
penguin_example %>% 
  mutate(species = fct_infreq(species)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(y = species)) + 
geom_bar(fill = "darkorchid3") +
labs(
  y = element_blank(),
  x = "Number of penguins",
  title = "Number of penguins at Palmer Station, Antarctica") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.1))) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.01))) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
  )
```

``` warning
Warning: `label` cannot be a <ggplot2::element_blank> object.
```

<img src="fig/barcharts-rendered-decluttering-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
First we change the default theme of the plot from `theme_grey` to `theme_minimal`,
which gets rid of the grey background. In the additional `theme()` function we 
remove the gridlines, both major and minor gridlines, on the y-axis, by setting them
to the speciel plot element `element_blank()`

## Add raw numbers to the plot

Especially for barcharts, it can make sense to add the raw values to the columns,
rather than relying on reading the values from the x-axis. 

That _can_ be done, but a more general, and easier to understand, approach is
to construct a dataframe with the data:


``` r
penguin_count <- count(penguin_example, species)
penguin_example %>% 
  mutate(species = fct_infreq(species)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = species)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "darkorchid3") +
  labs(
    y = element_blank(),
    x = element_blank(),
    title = "Number of penguins at Palmer Station, Antarctica") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.1))) +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
    theme(
      panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
      panel.grid.minor = element_blank()  ) +
  geom_text(data = penguin_count, mapping = aes(x = n, y = species, label = n),
    hjust = 1,
    nudge_x = -0.25,
    colour = "white") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = NULL, expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.01))) 
```

``` warning
Warning: `label` cannot be a <ggplot2::element_blank> object.
`label` cannot be a <ggplot2::element_blank> object.
```

<img src="fig/barcharts-rendered-count_penguins-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />


In general it is a good idea to remove all extraneous pixels in the graph. And 
when we add the counts directly to the plot, we can get rid of the x-axis entirely.

On the other hand, it can be a good idea in this specific example, to add a 
vertical indication of where the x=0 intercept is: `geom_vline(xintercept = 0)`.

And: Always remember to think about the contrast between the colour of the 
bars and the text!

## Add labels to the plot


We can do the same with labels if we want:


``` r
penguin_example %>% 
  mutate(species = fct_infreq(species)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = species)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "darkorchid3") +
  labs(
    y = NULL,
    x = "Number of penguins",
    title = "Number of penguins at Palmer Station, Antarctica"  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.1)),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.01)), breaks = NULL) +
  scale_y_discrete(breaks = NULL) +
  geom_text(
    data = penguin_count,
    mapping = aes(x = n, y = species, label = n),
    hjust = 1,
    nudge_x = -0.25,
    colour = "white"  ) +
  geom_text(
    data = penguin_count,
    mapping = aes(x = 0, y = species, label = species),
    hjust = 0,
    nudge_x = 0.25,
    colour = "white",
    fontface = "bold",
    size = 4.5  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)
```

## Slimmer bars

Depending on aspect ratio of the final plot, number of categories etc, we
might want to adjust the width of the bars:


``` r
penguin_example %>% 
  mutate(species = fct_infreq(species)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = species)) + 
  geom_bar(
    fill = "darkorchid3",
    width = 0.4  ) +
  labs(
    y = NULL,
    x = "Number of penguins",
    title = "Number of penguins at Palmer Station, Antarctica"  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.1)),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.01)), breaks = NULL) +
  scale_y_discrete(breaks = NULL) +
  geom_text(
    data = penguin_count,
    mapping = aes(x = n, y = species, label = n),
    hjust = 1,
    nudge_y = 0.1,
    colour = "white",
    size = 5.5  ) +
  geom_text(
    data = penguin_count,
    mapping = aes(x = 0, y = species, label = species),
    hjust = 0, 
    nudge_x = 0.5, 
    nudge_y = 0.1,
    colour = "white", 
    fontface = "bold", 
    size = 4.5  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)
```
